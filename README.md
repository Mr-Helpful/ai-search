# AI Search Algorithms

## Introduction

This is a WIP package that implements some pretty common AI search methods.
I've mostly created this to support a few other projects I'm working on and have found that
I commonly need these types of algorithms.

## Current Algorithms

### Uninformed Searches

- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Iterative Deepening Search

### Informed Searches

- Uniform Cost Search
- Greedy Best First Search
- A* Search
