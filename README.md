# AI Search Algorithms

## Introduction

This is a WIP package that implements some pretty common AI search methods.
I've mostly created as I've commonly found I need some of these algorithms in other projects
I've been working on.

## Algorithms

- [X] Breadth First Search
- [X] Depth First Search
- [X] Iterative Deepening Search

### Informed Search

- [X] Uniform Cost Search
- [X] Greedy Best First Search
- [X] A* Search

### Games

- [ ] Minimax Search
- [ ] Alpha Beta Pruning
